#### 1. PR_DESCRIPTION.md
Complete, ready-to-use pull request description covering all requirements:
- What the file contains (RAL approximations with sRGB swatches and typical use cases per color)
- Notes about color approximation and verification with physical RAL charts/campioni
- Suggestions for future improvement (optional local PNG swatches in swatches/ folder)

#### 2. create-pr.sh
Executable script for creating the PR using gh CLI (requires authentication)

#### 3. create-pr-api.sh  
Executable script for creating the PR using GitHub REST API (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)

#### 4. INSTRUCTIONS.md
Comprehensive instructions with multiple methods:
- GitHub web interface (step-by-step)
- GitHub CLI commands
- GitHub API curl commands

## How to Create the PR

### Recommended: GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/DFFM-maker/color
2. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
3. Base: `main`, Compare: `feat/colori-resine-sport`
4. Click "Create pull request"
5. Title: "Add sports resin flooring color palette with RAL approximations and visual swatches"
6. Copy description from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md`
7. Click "Create pull request"

### Alternative: With Authentication

If you have gh CLI authenticated or a GITHUB_TOKEN:

```bash
# Using gh CLI
gh pr create \
  --repo "DFFM-maker/color" \
  --base "main" \
  --head "feat/colori-resine-sport" \
  --title "Add sports resin flooring color palette with RAL approximations and visual swatches" \
  --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md

# OR using the prepared script
./create-pr.sh
```

## What the PR Will Contain

### Changes
- **New file**: `colori-resine-impianti-sportivi.md` (31 lines)
- **Modified file**: README.md (simplified)

### Content of the New File
A Markdown table with:
- 17 RAL colors for sports flooring
- Visual swatches (24x24 pixel images via singlecolorimage.com)
- HEX color codes (sRGB approximations)
- Typical use cases for each color
- Technical notes about:
  - Color approximation warnings
  - Verification requirements
  - Application recommendations
  - Future improvement suggestions

### Key Points from PR Description

**What the file contains:**
- RAL approximations with visual swatches
- sRGB HEX values
- Typical applications (tennis, basketball, volleyball, padel, etc.)
- 17 colors across blues, greens, reds, grays, and neutrals

**Color Approximation Notes:**
- Colors are sRGB screen approximations only
- Always verify with physical RAL charts (mazzette RAL)
- Verify with applied samples (campioni applicati)
- Appearance varies by finish, texture, thickness, lighting

**Future Improvements:**
- Generate local PNG swatches in `swatches/` folder
- Use relative paths instead of external URLs
- Eliminates external dependencies
- Ensures long-term availability

## Verification

The `feat/colori-resine-sport` branch is confirmed to:
- ✅ Exist in the remote repository
- ✅ Contain the color palette file
- ✅ Be based on the correct commit  
- ✅ Have appropriate commit message
- ✅ Be ready for merging to main

## Next Steps

1. Create the PR using one of the methods above
2. Review the PR to ensure accuracy
3. Optionally add labels, reviewers, or milestones
4. Merge when ready

- `create-pr.sh` - gh CLI creation script
- `create-pr-api.sh` - API creation script
