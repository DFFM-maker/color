# Instructions for Creating the Pull Request

## Current Situation

The branch `feat/colori-resine-sport` has been prepared and pushed to the remote repository with the following:

- **New file**: `colori-resine-impianti-sportivi.md`
- **Content**: A comprehensive color palette for sports resin flooring with RAL approximations and visual swatches
- **Commit**: "Add markdown palette with visible color swatches for sports resin flooring"
- **Status**: Ready to be merged into `main` branch

## What Cannot Be Done Automatically

Due to authentication constraints in this sandboxed environment:
- Cannot directly create Pull Requests using `gh CLI` (requires GH_TOKEN)
- Cannot use GitHub API directly without authentication credentials
- Cannot push or modify branches other than the working branch

## What Has Been Prepared

1. **PR_DESCRIPTION.md**: A comprehensive pull request description covering all requirements
2. **create-pr.sh**: An executable script that documents the exact command to create the PR
3. **This file**: Instructions for completing the task

## How to Create the Pull Request

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/DFFM-maker/color
2. Click on "Pull requests" tab
3. Click "New pull request" button
4. Set base branch to: `main`
5. Set compare branch to: `feat/colori-resine-sport`
6. Review the changes (should show the new file `colori-resine-impianti-sportivi.md`)
7. Click "Create pull request"
8. Use the title: "Add sports resin flooring color palette with RAL approximations and visual swatches"
9. Copy and paste the content from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` into the PR description
10. Click "Create pull request" to finalize

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (gh)

If you have `gh` CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /home/runner/work/color/color

# Run the prepared script
./create-pr.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --repo "DFFM-maker/color" \
  --base "main" \
  --head "feat/colori-resine-sport" \
  --title "Add sports resin flooring color palette with RAL approximations and visual swatches" \
  --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md
```

### Option 3: Using GitHub API

If you prefer using the REST API directly:

```bash
# Set your GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Create the PR
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/DFFM-maker/color/pulls \
  -d '{
    "title": "Add sports resin flooring color palette with RAL approximations and visual swatches",
    "body": "See PR_DESCRIPTION.md for full details",
    "head": "feat/colori-resine-sport",
    "base": "main"
  }'
```
